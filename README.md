# Smart LED Alarm
A Raspberry Pi synced with my Fitbit sleep data to control a LED strip.

### Idea
- RESTful APIs to control the LED strip
- Possible integration with Google Assistant through my RESTful APIs and IFTTT
- Getting the sleep data from Fitbit to find the best time to wake me up

### Endpoints
- Turn on LED strip 
- Turn off LED strip
- Set an hex color for the LED strip
